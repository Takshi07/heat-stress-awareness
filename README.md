# 📌 Project Overview

The **AI-Based Heat Stress Awareness Assistant** is an interactive **Streamlit web dashboard** designed to help users understand, assess, and visualize heat stress risks caused by rising temperatures and extreme working conditions.

This project focuses on **awareness and prevention**, not medical diagnosis. Using **transparent rule-based logic** combined with an **AI-style explanation layer**, the tool helps workers, planners, and organizations make informed decisions about heat exposure, hydration, and rest strategies.

**The dashboard is suitable for:**
- Outdoor workers
- Construction and industrial safety teams
- Urban planners
- Climate resilience researchers
- Educational and policy-awareness use cases

# 🌍 Sustainability & SDG Impact

- **SDG 3 (Good Health & Well-being):** Reduces heat-related health risks through awareness and early warnings
- **SDG 13 (Climate Action):** Addresses climate-driven heat stress impacts in real-world environments

By promoting safer work practices under extreme heat, the project contributes to **climate adaptation and worker well-being**.

# 🧮 Risk Modeling Logic

| Factor        | Condition       | Score                     |
|---------------|----------------|---------------------------|
| Temperature   | ≥ 40°C         | +3                        |
| Temperature   | 35–39°C        | +2                        |
| Humidity      | ≥ 70%          | +2                        |
| Work Duration | ≥ 6 hrs        | +2                        |
| Activity      | Light / Moderate / Heavy | +1 / +2 / +3 |

**Risk Levels:**
- High: Score ≥ 8
- Moderate: Score 5–7
- Low: Score ≤ 4

# ⚖️ Responsible AI Principles

- **Transparency:** All risk calculations are rule-based and explainable
- **Fairness:** No personal or demographic data is collected
- **Ethics:** The system provides awareness only, not diagnosis
- **Privacy:** No user data is stored externally
- **Safety:** Clear disclaimers and non-alarmist guidance
